# WaniWords (wip title)

This project is designed for WaniKani users to maximize their kanji learning by discovering commonly used words that WaniKani doesn't cover. Often, WaniKani introduces a kanji with only a few associated words, leaving gaps in vocabulary. This project identifies commonly used words made up of kanji the user already knows, providing a list of easily learnable, high-value words. This way, users can efficiently expand their vocabulary by focusing on these "low-hanging fruit."
## Features

- Load user's learning data from WaniKani
- Create lists of words, filtered with various criteria
- Generate a vocabulary deck on the website jpdb.io for learning

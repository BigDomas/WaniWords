# WaniWords

This project is designed for WaniKani users to maximize their kanji learning by discovering commonly used words that WaniKani doesn't cover. Often, WaniKani introduces a kanji with only a few associated words, leaving gaps in vocabulary. This project identifies commonly used words made up of kanji the user already knows, providing a list of easily learnable, high-value words. This way, users can efficiently expand their vocabulary by focusing on these "low-hanging fruit."
## Features

- Easy to use (though a bit ugly) GUI
- Locally cache user's API keys and WaniKani user data for repeated use
- Create lists of words, filtered with various criteria
- Generate a vocabulary deck on jpdb.io for studying
